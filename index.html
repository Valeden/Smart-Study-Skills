                <p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, 
                actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.</p>

                <h3>Concrete Examples</h3>
                <p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know.
                Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>

                <p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
